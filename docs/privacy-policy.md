# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when using our Chrome extension, which is designed to help developers analyze and debug Salesforce logs. By using our extension, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

## Data Collection

Our Chrome extension collects the following data:

- **Salesforce Session Cookies**: To authenticate and authorize your access to Salesforce logs, we use Salesforce session cookies. These cookies enable the extension to access your Salesforce environment securely without requiring repeated logins.
- **Debug Log Data**: The extension retrieves debug logs from your Salesforce instance for analysis, including performance metrics, DML/SOQL operations, and execution timelines.
  
We do not store any personal data or sensitive information beyond the scope required for analyzing the logs.

## Use of Data

The data we collect is used for the following purposes:

- **Salesforce Session Authentication**: We use the session cookie to maintain your login state and authenticate your access to Salesforce debug logs.
- **Debug Log Analysis**: The extension uses the retrieved log data to generate various analysis views, such as flame charts, call trees, and performance metrics, to help you troubleshoot and optimize your Salesforce code.

## Data Sharing

We do not share or sell any of your data to third parties. All data is processed locally within the extension and is only used for the purpose of debugging and analyzing Salesforce logs. We do not store any logs or session information beyond the current session.

## Security

We take your privacy seriously and have implemented measures to ensure that your data remains secure:

- **Session Cookies**: All cookies are used solely for maintaining the session and are not stored or shared beyond the current session.
- **No Data Storage**: We do not store any personal data, debug logs, or session cookies after the session ends. All collected data is used only temporarily for analysis during the active session.

## Third-Party Services

Our extension may interface with Salesforce, but we do not use any third-party services to process or store your data. All data is processed directly within the extension itself.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access**: You can view and analyze the debug logs retrieved from your Salesforce instance.
- **Deletion**: Since we do not store any user data, once the session ends, all data is automatically deleted from our systems.
- **Opt-Out**: You can stop using the extension at any time, which will prevent us from accessing your Salesforce data.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting an updated policy within the extension.
