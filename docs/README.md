> In general set the `APEX_CODE` debug flag to be `FINE` or higher, with a lower level the log will likely not contain enough detail for meaningful analysis.


 Inspired by the challenges of debugging an app in VSCode, where the system sometimes failed to recognize it, I decided to create a Chrome extension to simplify the process. This extension is my way of making debugging smoother for others, born from the desire to solve a real-world problem.
